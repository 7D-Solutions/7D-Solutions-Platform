# Timekeeping Module — Vision & Roadmap

**Version**: 0.1.0
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-25
**Status**: Active

---

## 1. Mission

Timekeeping is the **time and labor authority** — it captures employee time entries, manages approval workflows, allocates costs to projects/jobs, and generates payroll/billing exports. Timekeeping answers "who worked on what, for how long, and at what rate?"

### Non-Goals

Timekeeping does **NOT**:
- Own employee identity (Party Master owns canonical identity)
- Own payroll processing (export data consumed by external payroll systems)
- Own project financial budgets (future module or product-layer concern)
- Post GL entries directly (future: via `gl.posting.requested`)

---

## 2. Domain Authority

| Domain Entity | Timekeeping Authority |
|---|---|
| **Employees** | Employee master for time tracking context |
| **Projects** | Project/job definitions for time allocation |
| **Timesheet Entries** | Individual time records with hours, date, project, billing rate |
| **Approvals** | Timesheet approval workflow state |
| **Allocations** | Cost allocation to projects/jobs |
| **Exports** | Payroll and billing export batches (content-hash deduped) |
| **Billing Rates** | Per-employee or per-project billing rates |

---

## 3. Data Ownership

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tk_employees` | Employee records for time tracking |
| `tk_projects` | Project/job definitions |
| `tk_tasks` | Task breakdown within projects |
| `tk_timesheet_entries` | Time records with hours, date, project, rates |
| `tk_approval_requests` | Approval status per employee per period |
| `tk_approval_actions` | Audit trail for approval transitions |
| `tk_allocations` | Cost allocation records |
| `tk_export_runs` | Export batch records with content hash |
| `tk_billing_rates` | Named hourly billing rates per tenant |
| `tk_billing_runs` | Aggregated billing records |
| `tk_billing_run_entries` | Links billing runs to entries |
| `tk_idempotency_keys` | HTTP-level API idempotency |
| `events_outbox` | Module outbox for NATS |
| `processed_events` | Consumer idempotency |

---

## 4. Events

**Produces:**
- `timesheet_entry.created` — new time entry created
- `timesheet_entry.corrected` — existing entry corrected
- `timesheet_entry.voided` — entry voided (cancelled)
- `timesheet.submitted` — timesheet submitted for approval
- `timesheet.approved` — timesheet approved by reviewer
- `timesheet.rejected` — timesheet rejected by reviewer
- `timesheet.recalled` — timesheet recalled by employee
- `export_run.completed` — export run generated
- `timekeeping.labor_cost` — GL labor cost accrual generated
- `timekeeping.billable_time` — AR billable time exported

**Consumes:**
- None currently

---

## 5. Key Invariants

1. Approved entries are immutable (must void and re-enter)
2. Export batches are content-hash deduplicated
3. Billing rates apply in priority order: entry override > project rate > employee rate
4. Tenant isolation on every table and query

---

## 6. Integration Map

- **Party** → employee identity may reference party_id (future)
- **GL** → future: labor cost posting via `gl.posting.requested`
- **AR** → future: billable time → invoice line items
- **Maintenance** → future: labor hours on work orders

---
