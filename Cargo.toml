# Future: shared dependencies can be defined here
# [workspace.dependencies]

# Note: Full workspace build requires dependency version alignment.
# Currently AUTH uses sqlx 0.7, AR uses sqlx 0.8.
# Modules can still be built independently:
#   cd platform/identity-auth && cargo build
#   cd modules/ar && cargo build
